      We all collect moments and pieces of knowledge, most of which will
      disappear with us. Some may get recorded, some may get rediscovered by
      others, but most will be lost forever. <br/> <br/> Roy wanted Deckard to remember him.
      Isn't that a form of human existence too?
      <br/> <br/> <span class="font-bold">Fact:</span> A different monologue was in
      the original script. Rutger Hauer felt the way it was originally written
      was too long. He said, given that Roy knew his built-in death was a very
      short time away, it didn't make sense to him that he would be able to sit
      and talk for very long about life and death, and the things he's seen. <br
      />
      <br /> So he decided to came up with something much more concise by re-writing
      it himself the night before shooting the scene, without Ridley Scott's knowledge.
      He not only re-wrote the existing lines, but also added the immortal last words
      <br />
      <br />
      <span class="italic">"... like tears in rain. Time to die."</span>
      <br /><br />
      Apparently loads of people were crying on set at that point. It was a combination
      of the film's hellish shoot being nearly over, and being so moved by Hauer's
      words.He did his version of the monologue on set, which surprised Scott and
      the rest of the crew, but they all loved his version, and it was ultimately
      decided to kept it as that.

  <Text title="A virtual reality doesn't exist physically." class="font-mono">
    <p>
      By virtually I mean phenomenally. Obviously the brain and body are real,
      but the self as we understand it is an illusion, it only exists virtually.
      It only exists as an experience and as a cognitive construct of brains in
      order for an organism or biological system to model itself in relation to
      the world surrounding it. <br /><br />If you get your brain hooked up to
      certain equipment in a lab, a neuroscientist can tell you you will be
      making a certain decision before you even know. The brain activity happens
      before the knowledge of the decision is integrated into the self-model.
      Dreams, hallucinations, mental imagery & thoughts all exist in an
      exclusive virtual space, not physically. <br /><br />
      They are all a product of certain types of brain activity, and the self as
      we use and understand it and the <span class="italic">"I"</span> as I am using
      it here is no different. The self is an illusion in the sense that we feel
      we are an experiencer in addition to the experience, that we are some type
      of entity riding around in a head and body. <br /><br /> We are characters
      generated by our brains. Our brains are hardwired to have these egos. No amount
      of knowledge or awareness of out own virtual nature is going to make it go
      away. In fact, this knowledge can be a convenient mean for an egotistical person
      to be an asshole or dismiss other people's pain and hardship, such as Carey
      is doing here. <br /><br /> Psychedelics can dissolve the ego, but only temporarily.
      Meditation has been shown to be an effective long term method, but perhabs
      the solution comes in the form of realizing that nothing is inherently wrong
      with living as an ego. Afterall, if you didn't have one, you wouldn't be sure
      whose mouth to put food into. <br /><br />
    </p>

      <span class="italic">
        An imaginary friend is a direct product of the brain. Is an imaginary
        friend an illusion? Electricity is physical, energy is physical, yet my
        imaginary friend remains virtual. He, will never be equal to my father,
        the same way that hallucinated water never will be able to quench my
        thirst quite like physical water.
