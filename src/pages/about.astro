          I now navigate this digital frontier. <br /> <br/> I believe the technology we interact with
          daily, through our mere fingertips, has unprecedented potential to propel us towards a better future.
          <br />
          <br /> I champion open-source solutions, community-driven projects, and free
          tools.
          This approach creates a competitive landscape where quality and
          creativity determine success. <br />

        <p class="text-lg text-black/80 leading-relaxed mt-4 font-mono">
          Im studying Software Engineering at Aarhus University, which has opened my eyes to
          the power of education and research. The last couple of years I've seen firsthand
          how learning transforms people, and how those people change the world. <br />
          <br />
          Universities aren't just about getting jobs - they're about growing as
          individuals and advancing human knowledge together. <br />
          <br />
          When we invest in education, we invest in our collective future and our potential
          as a species.

          I reject the notion that corporate interests and capital should dictate the
          trajectory of human progress. Too often, the relentless pursuit of
          profit undermines the fundamental needs and aspirations of individuals. <br
          />
          <br />
          My stance isn't against commerce itself, but against systems that reduce
          people to metrics and creativity to commodities. <br />
          <br />
          I envision a world where markets serve as genuine platforms for innovation
          and exchange, fostering fair competition rather than entrenching privilege.
          <br />

        <p class="text-lg text-black/80 leading-relaxed mt-4 font-mono">
          My worldview is anchored in <span class="font-bold">Stoic</span> principles
          and <span class="font-bold">Christian</span> values. <br />
          <br />
          I find strength in accepting what I cannot change and taking responsibility
          for what I can. <br />
          <br />
          I believe in the dignity of every individual and our collective capacity
          for growth through adversity. <br />
          <br />
          This serves as the foundation of my approach to both technology and life: Pursuing
          excellence, chasing virtue, embracing simplicity, holding firm to my principles,
          and serving something greater than self-interest.
